# gravity_planets
Objective:
 Create a python app that shows how an object drops from top to the ground on planet earth, moon, and mars based on gravity and show action using graphics.

Solution:
 Use Python, and Turtle for graphics. Use the gravity as we know from each planet/moon/sun.

Observation:
The weight (or mass) of the object does not affect the acceleration due to gravity, as long as there is no air resistance.
This means that the drop function does not need to consider the weight of the object, only the gravity value of each planet/location.
Mass and weight are independent of each other when it comes to free fall. ie. Light objects and heavy objects will fall at the same rate if there are no other forces acting on them, such as air resistance.
